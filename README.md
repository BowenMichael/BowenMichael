#### My name is Michael Bowen and I am a Game Developer. I specialize in game devops, gameplay, and REST API development. 

## Here are some of the projects I have been working on recently:
* An Unreal Engine 5 game that utilizes Google Cloud + Jenkins to automate building and distributing the game. [Build Commands Repo](https://github.com/depth-grobblers/fa22-capstone-2022-23-t06-build-commands) 
* A VR game that leverages the Oculus hand-tracking library to interact with the world. 
* Created the [Turbo-hybrid game engine](https://github.com/StevenAnnunziato/VRUnity/tree/Hand_Tracking) which features a structured array of components, JSON data serialization, and 3D renderer. 

### The significance of software
The significance of software and the internet is hard to understate. However, I believe that software still has room to improve in social and simplicity. I want to create and work on projects that develop a deeper connection between people while offering a fast, simple and understandable interface for the users and developers to interact with.

### My Motivations 
VR for social and fully body interaction, DevOps to increase developer efficency, and understanding the full stack of an application are core to my motivations as a developer.
